  <h1>Click Alonzo Game</h1>

  <p>Alonzo is a quick, slippery sprite. Can you click fast enough to capture him?</p>

  <!-- begin main lesson sequence -->

      <img src="1_click_alonzo_images/image1.png" style="width:90%;">
    <li>
      <p>
      Make Alonzo jump someplace else on the <strong>stage</strong> when he's
      clicked. Drag these two blocks into the <strong>scripting area</strong> (the
      center area of the window):
      </p>
      <img src="1_click_alonzo_images/image8.png" style="width:200px">
      <img src="1_click_alonzo_images/image11.png" style="width:200px">
      <p>
      To find a block, look for the matching color palette in the top left.
      </p>
      <img src="1_click_alonzo_images/image13.png" style="width:200px">
    <li>
      <p>Test your program. Click on the Alonzo <strong>sprite</strong> several
      times. If your program works, Alonzo should move to a random position on
      the <strong>stage</strong> each time you click him.</p>
    <li>
      <p>Once you've clicked him, you want him to keep jumping around on his
      own. Attach this to the bottom of your program:</p>
      <img src="1_click_alonzo_images/image16.png" style="width:200px">
      <img src="1_click_alonzo_images/image5.gif" style="width:200px">
    <li>
      <p>Whoa! Alonzo moves too fast. Click
      <img src="1_click_alonzo_images/image4.png">
      to stop your program.  Slow him down by using
      <img src="1_click_alonzo_images/image15.png" style="height:25px">.
      Where should you put it? Do you want a longer or slower wait time?</p>
    <li>
      <p>Program Alonzo to face the other way when clicked, using
      <img src="1_click_alonzo_images/image7.png" style="height:25px"></p>
    <li>
      <p>Test your program. Make sure Alonzo faces the other way when he is
      clicked, <em>but not when he jumps without being clicked.</em></p>
    <li>
      <p>Let's make Alonzo more invisible with every click.
      The player wins when Alonzo disappears completely.  Drag
      <img src="1_click_alonzo_images/image3.png" style="height:25px">
      into the center scripting area, and experiment with different
      <strong>input</strong> numbers. Click it repeatedly after each change to
      see what happens. At what ghost effect value does Alonzo become
      completely invisible?
      </p>
      <img src="1_click_alonzo_images/image12.png">
      <p>
      To make Alonzo fully visible again, use
      <img src="1_click_alonzo_images/image18.png" style="height:25px">
      </p>
    <li>
      <p>Modify your program so that every time Alonzo is clicked, he gets a
      little more ghostly. Try out your game. How does the
      <strong>input</strong> you use affect the length of the game?</p>
    <li>
      <p>The game will be more interesting if the player is penalized for
      missing a click. Figure out where to add another
      <img src="1_click_alonzo_images/image3.png" style="height:25px">,
      inputting a <em>negative</em> number (try -5), to make Alonzo get less
      transparent if he moves without being clicked.</p>
    <li>
      <p>When Alonzo is completely transparent, the game should stop. Add this
      code to the right place in your program to end the game.</p>
      <img src="1_click_alonzo_images/image14.png">
    <li>
      <p>Play your game a few times. Adjust your code to get a level of
      difficulty that you like. What should you change to make it harder?
      Easier?
    <li>
      <p>Click the red stop sign
      <img src="1_click_alonzo_images/image4.png">
      at the top right.</p>
    <li>
      <p>Create a second <strong>script</strong> to make Alonzo say a welcome
      message when at the top right is clicked. Use the blocks:</p>
      <img src="1_click_alonzo_images/image17.png", style="height:45px">
      <img src="1_click_alonzo_images/image6.png", style="height:30px">
      <p>A <strong>script</strong> is a bunch of blocks snapped together.<br>
      A <strong>program</strong> is all of your scripts, sprites, and stage(s)
      working together.</p>
    <li>
      <p>Go back to your first script. Make the welcome message disappear when
      the player clicks on Alonzo, by using
      <img src="1_click_alonzo_images/image6.png">
      with nothing inside.</p>
    <li>
      <div class="forYouToDo">
      Check that your app does everything you want:
      <ul>
        <li>When the green flag is clicked, Alonzo should welcome the player.
        <li>When Alonzo is clicked, the message should disappear, and Alonzo
          should move to a random spot on the stage, face the other way, and
          get more transparent.
        <li>Alonzo should start to reappear (but shouldn't face the other way)
          any time he moves without being clicked.
      </ul>
      </div>
  </ol>

  <p>Congratulations, you have created the game "Click Alonzo!"</p>
