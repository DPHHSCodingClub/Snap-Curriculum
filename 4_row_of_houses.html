    <h1>Row of Houses</h1>

    <p>So far, you've used only pre-made blocks. Now, you'll learn to build
    your own blocks and use them to make other blocks.</p>

    <p>You'll start by defining a <code class="motion">draw square</code> block. Then,
    you'll define <code class="motion">draw triangle</code>, then <code class="motion">draw
      house</code>, and finally <code class="motion">draw row of houses</code>.</p>

      <li>
        <p><a href="https://snap.berkeley.edu/snap/snap.html"
            target=”_blank”>Click here</a> to open a new blank project.</p>

      <li>
        <div class="forYouToDo">
        Build the <code class="motion">draw square</code> block: right-click on the
        gray background of the scripting area and choose "make a block...".
        The video below shows how.
        <br><br>
        <em>Right-click on Chromebooks and Macs: press or tap the touchpad with two fingers.<br>
          Chromebooks: you can also press Alt, then click with one finger.<br>
          Macs: you can also press Control (not Command!), then click with one finger.<br>
        </em>
        </div>
        <img src="4_row_of_houses_images/make-block.gif">

      <li>
        <div class="forYouToDo">
        Every block needs a <strong>palette</strong> (shown by the color), a
        <strong>title</strong>, a <strong>category</strong> (shown by the
        shape of the block), and a <strong>script</strong> that defines its
        behavior.
        <br>
        <br>
        We recommend the following settings for your first custom block.
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Palette (color):</strong> <code class="motion">Motion</code> or <code class="pen">Pen</code>. But any is OK.
          <li><strong>Title:</strong> “draw square”.
          <li><strong>Category (shape):</strong> don’t change this, leave “Command” selected.
          <li><strong>For all sprites:</strong> don’t change this, leave “For all sprites” selected.
          <li><strong>Script:</strong> drag any block you want into the block editor.
        </ul>
        </div>

      <li>
        <p>Finish building the block, like below. When you are done, click
        “OK” or “Apply”.</p>
        <img src="4_row_of_houses_images/draw-square.png">

      <li>
        <p>Test your <code class="motion">draw square</code> block.
        Fix your code if necessary.  Remember you will need the
        <code class="pen">pen down</code> block, like below.</p>
        <img src="4_row_of_houses_images/main-script.png">

      <li>
        <p>Create a <code class="motion">draw triangle</code>
        block that draws an equilateral triangle with the same side length as
        the square you just drew (50).</p>

      <li>
        <p>Create a <code class="motion">draw house</code> block that uses your
        <code class="motion">draw square</code> and <code class="motion">draw
        triangle</code> blocks together to draw a "house" shape. You might have
        to do some work to get the two shapes to connect properly.</p>
        <img src="4_row_of_houses_images/house.png">

      <li>
        <p>Build a <code class="motion">draw row of houses</code> block that
        draws a row of attached houses, each new one to the right of the
        previous, until you hit the right edge of the screen.  You may wish to
        use the following blocks.</p>

        <img src="4_row_of_houses_images/row-houses.png">

      <li>
        <p>(optional) Imagine: what else could you make with this ability?  A
        block of ornate brownstones?  The Manhattan skyline?
        The <code class="operators">pick random</code> block may be useful.</p>
