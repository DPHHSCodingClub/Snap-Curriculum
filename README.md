README
======

This repository contains introductory Snap! and HTML labs, which can be viewed
at:
[https://dphhscodingclub.github.io/curriculum](https://dphhscodingclub.github.io/curriculum)

The content is heavily based upon UC Berkeley's
[Beauty and Joy of Computing](https://bjc.edc.org/) curriculum
and
[Toni Scullion's HTML/CSS curriculum](https://docs.replit.com/teaching-curriculum/intro-html-css)
which is in turn built upon
the [Raspberry Pi Foundation's HTML/CSS projects](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects?software%5B%5D=html-css-javascript).
