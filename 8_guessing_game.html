    <h1>Guessing Game</h1>

    <p>Let's build a number guessing game where the player tries to guess a secret number!</p>
    
    <p>In the last project, Keeping Score, you created <strong>global variables</strong> such as <code class="variables">score</code> that kept track of how many times players successfully clicked Alonzo. We call them <strong>global</strong> because all parts of the code can access the value stored in them.</p>

    <p>However, it would be a pretty boring guessing game if anyone could access what the secret number is. Instead, we can use <strong>local variables</strong> (which Snap! calls <strong>scripting variables</strong>) that only parts of the code have access to.</p>
    
    <p>If you've done the Row of Dollhouses project, then you've already seen <strong>scripting variables</strong>: The inputs to custom blocks only exist within the block and can't be used outide of them.</p>

      <li>
        <p>Add a <strong>script variables</strong> block and create two new <strong>variables</strong> called <code class="variables">secret number</code> and <code class="variables">guess</code>.</p>
        <img src="8_guessing_game_images/script-var.png">
        <p>You can create multiple variables from the same <strong>scripting variable</strong> block by clicking the black arrow to the right of your variable name.</p>

          The <img src="8_guessing_game_images/ask.png" style="height:25px; vertical-align:middle;"> block under the "Sensing" palette will ask the player a question (which we can put in the blank space in the block), and then wait for the player to input an answer and press enter. Then, that answer will be stored in the <img src="8_guessing_game_images/answer.png" style="height:20px; vertical-align:middle;"> variable.
          <br><br>
          For example, the following block will cause the sprite to say "Guess what my number is!" and wait for a response.

        <p>And you can access the response by dragging the oval-shaped <img src="8_guessing_game_images/answer.png" style="height:20px; vertical-align:middle;"> block from the left-side bar under the "Sensing" palette:</p>
        <img src="8_guessing_game_images/drag-answer.png">
        <p>Set <code class="variables">secret number</code> to a random number (perhaps between 1 and 10) and ask the player to guess what it is. After the player answers, set <code class="variables">guess</code> equal to their <img src="8_guessing_game_images/answer.png" style="height:20px; vertical-align:middle;"> and check whether the two numbers match. Afterwards, have the </p>
