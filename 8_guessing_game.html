    <h1>Guessing Game</h1>

    <p>Let's build a number guessing game where the player tries to guess a secret number!</p>

            target=”_blank”>Click here</a> to open a new blank project.

          Create two new variables: <code class="variables">secret number</code> and <code class="variables">guess</code>.
          <br><br>
          If you have not yet done the last project, Keeping Score, then you can follow the instructions below to create new variables.

          The <img src="8_guessing_game_images/ask.png" style="height:25px; vertical-align:middle;"> block under the "Sensing" palette will ask the player a question (which we can put in the blank space in the block), and then wait for the player to input an answer and press enter. Then, that answer will be stored in the <img src="8_guessing_game_images/answer.png" style="height:20px; vertical-align:middle;"> variable.
          <br><br>
          For example, the following block will cause the sprite to say "Guess what my number is!" and wait for a response.
        </div>
        <img src="8_guessing_game_images/guess-number.png">
        <p>And you can access the response by dragging the oval-shaped <img src="8_guessing_game_images/answer.png" style="height:20px; vertical-align:middle;"> block from the left-side bar under the "Sensing" palette:</p>
        <img src="8_guessing_game_images/drag-answer.png">
        <p>Set <code class="variables">secret number</code> to a random number (perhaps between 1 and 10) and ask the player to guess what it is. After the player answers, set <code class="variables">guess</code> equal to their <img src="8_guessing_game_images/answer.png" style="height:20px; vertical-align:middle;"> and check whether the two numbers match. Afterwards, have the </p>

        <div class="forYouToDo">
          Hmmm, this guessing game is a bit too easy since our <code class="variables">secret number</code> is visible in the top left corner of the stage. If only there was a way to make the <code class="variables">secret number</code> actually secret!
          <br><br>
          So far you have used <strong>global variables</strong> that all parts of the code can access. There are different types of variables called <strong>local variables</strong> (which Snap! calls <strong>scripting variables</strong>) which can only be accessed in specific parts of the code. If you've done the Row of Dollhouses project, then you've already seen <strong>script variables</strong>: The inputs to custom blocks only exist within the block and can't be used outside of them.
          <br><br>
          <strong>Predict: what do you think this code will do?</strong>

        <p>Build the code above and run it several times. What happened? You can follow the steps below to create new <strong>script variables</strong>.</p>
        <img src="8_guessing_game_images/script-var.png">
        <p>You can create multiple variables from the same <strong>script variable</strong> block by clicking the black arrow to the right of your variable name.</p>

          You can personalize this project just like with the Sprite Chase project, by changing the sprite costumes and the backgrounds and having the sprites talk to each other.
